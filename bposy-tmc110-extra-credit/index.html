<p>My personal 10 year  goal is to perform in all the mainland states in America.<br>I want to see the world and experience different scenes and spread my art far and wide.<br>My professional 10 year goal is to work in web development. I also want to eventually develop a better ticketing site<br>for drag shows that is especially made for drag show ticket sales.<br> A site that can link people to performerâ€™s social media, where they can leave reviews about the show,<br>and one where they can search for a specific artist or a specific kind of drag.<br> I want to provide better advertisements for shows as well as the artists in the shows,<br> but I also want to find a way to eliminate having to charge people an extra $3 to buy a ticket online. </p>
